# Tenzies ðŸŽ²

This is a small dice game I built as part of my React course on Scrimba.

## How it works

- You have 10 dice.
- Click on a die to "hold" its value.
- Click the **Roll** button to re-roll the rest.
- The goal is to get all dice to show the same number.

## Built with

- React
- CSS Grid & Flexbox
- useState

## To run it

npm install
npm run dev
